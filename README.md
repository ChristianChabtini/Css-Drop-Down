Cross-Platform Css-Drop-Down
============================

Plan to develop css dropdown that works for as many devices as possible. This project is part of a bigger development
effort to create small UI components to work across many platforms and can be used with many existing development tool.
The list will be designed to support common web frameworks natively with optimization in mind. The approach is to 
have common sets of commands integrated into the attributes of the drop-down to customze.

First version will be to designed using Javascript and Css to get an optionally curvy drop-down with a picture choice
for the section where the user clicks. Also picture will be moveable to make code compatible with all languages and
allow more creative designs. 

First version should have all the necessary features such as mobile support and getter/setter 
functionalities such as setting the list to display, retrieving selected and reloading list. 

Moreover, allow grouping and textured backgrounds. Allowing checkboxes within the list displayed.  
Allow expanding the surrounding box to display a linear or matrix-like options to select from keeping all the
styling. Also, ability to add images within the list.

Main Characteristic:

- Ability to be deployed as an Asp User Control.
